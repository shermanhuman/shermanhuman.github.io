Description:
This website is a nostalgic, Commodore 64-inspired digital resume and blog platform. It emulates the look, feel, and behavior of a Commodore 64 computer, providing an authentic retro computing experience while showcasing modern web development techniques. The site features a boot sequence, a main menu, a viewable resume, and a blog section, all presented in the iconic Commodore 64 style.

Requirements:

Visual Design:

Use the characteristic Commodore 64 blue background (#4040e0) and light blue text (#a0a0ff).
Implement the VT323 Google font throughout the entire site.

Boot Sequence:

Display the first three lines of the boot sequence instantly (from ROM):

"**** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****"
"64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE"
"READY."

The load command should appear character by character with a short delay, to simulate someone typing:

"LOAD "MENU",8,1"

Show subsequent boot lines; line by line with a delay to simulate loading:

"SEARCHING FOR MENU"
"LOADING"
"READY."

Display a flashing rectangular cursor for a second.

After this boot sequence display the main menu.

Main Menu:

Present options for "VIEW RESUME" and "VIEW BLOG".
Allow navigation using arrow keys, Enter key, or number keys.
Highlight the currently selected menu item.
Focus should be managed to enable keyboard navigation.

Allow selection of individual blog posts.
Load and display blog posts.
Posts are found in the blog/ subdirectory.
Posts are in the .md format and titles are pulled from the first markdown #header found.

Boot Simulation:

Use authentic Commodore 64 syntax for loading content (e.g., "LOAD "RESUME",8,1").
Display "SEARCHING FOR..." and "LOADING" messages during content transitions.
Implement short pauses to simulate realistic loading times.

Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.
Remove any visible outlines or highlights on focused elements to maintain C64 aesthetics.


Content Management:

Store the resume content in a separate Markdown file for easy updates.
